FUNCTIONS: reusable collections of statements

var calculatorOn = false;

function pressPowerButton() {
  if (calculatorOn) {
    console.log('Calculator Turning Off');
    calculatorOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator Turning On');
    calculatorOn = true;
  }
}

pressPowerButton();
//Output: Calculator Turning off

start with JS Keyword - function
function name = pressPowerButton
Between the {} is the code block that the function is processing (currently an if/else statement)
Call the function (ie, run the code inside the functions code block) using pressPowerButton()


WHILE LOOP
x = 0
while (x < 12) {
  console.log(x)
  x = x + 1      (this is your modification)
}

1. Define x
2. create your while statement -- Remember you have to modify x or it will run forever!

//Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
(if you want it to print up to 12, you have to make it [while (x <= 12)])

FOR LOOP
for (var i = 0; i <= 12; i++) {
console.log('i is now ' + i);
}

i <= 12 is you condition. Here is where you set what stops the loop.
i++ (alt: i = i + 1, i = i + 2 is looped number)

EXAMPLES

var x = 15;
if (x <= 10) {
  alert('Your Variable is less than or equal to 10!');
} else {
  console.log('Your variable was ' + x + ', which is greater then 10.');
}

//Output: Your variable was 15 which is greater than 10
